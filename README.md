# Connect_4
Connect_4 is a simple board game. It is similar to TicTacToe. You have to play against the algorithm and win the game. I have used minMax algorithm to implement the comp player. I have also optimised the algo  by using alpha beta pruning.

**OBJECTIVE:**

To be the first player to connect 4 of the same colored discs in a row (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally)

**HOW TO PLAY:**
 
Player must alternate turns with the comp, and only one disc can be placed in each turn. 
On your turn, place one of your colored discs in any of the seven columns. 
You can only place the disc in a column only if all the discs below it are filled.
The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.
